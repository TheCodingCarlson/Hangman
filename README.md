# Hangman

###Basic Info
The classic word guessing game that we all know and love styled with a Western theme! Start the game by hitting the play button. Then choose a difficulty (easy, medium, hard). Press letter buttons to see if the chosen letter is in the word or not. You have six guesses. For every wrong answer a portion of the hangman will be drawn. Guess all the correct letters in the word before you run out of turns to win!

###Obstacles

Breaking up my drawing into various sections that would start and stop depending on if a player guessed a wrong letter or not. Had to get creative with the plug-in.

###Goals

Add on a feature where the player can see the definition of the word after the round has been completed.
